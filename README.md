# Stock Price Prediction using Support Vector Regression (SVR) for ACE Hardware Indonesia Tbk

## Overview

This repository contains a stock price prediction model for ACE Hardware Indonesia Tbk using the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm. The model undergoes hyperparameter tuning and evaluation using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Additionally, a comparative analysis with the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is performed.

## Features

- **SVR Model:** Utilizes the Support Vector Regression algorithm for predicting stock prices.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Fine-tunes model hyperparameters for optimal performance.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assesses model performance using MSE, MAE, and RMSE metrics.
- **KNN Comparison:** Compares the SVR model's performance with that of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm.
- **Data Source:** Historical stock price data for ACE Hardware Indonesia Tbk.

## Instructions

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Ensure you have preprocessed the historical stock price data before running the models. This may include handling missing values, scaling, and feature engineering.

2. **SVR Model:** Run the SVR model script to train and test the stock price prediction using Support Vector Regression.

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Experiment with hyperparameter tuning to optimize the SVR model's performance.

4. **Evaluation:** Evaluate the model using provided metrics (MSE, MAE, RMSE) and compare it with the KNN algorithm.
